Difference between ReadKey and ReadLine

ReadKey() makes the program wait for a key press and it prevents the screen from running
closing quickly when the program is launched from Visual Studio. NET

ReadLine() reads input from the console and return them as a string.

My take on ReadKey() was that the program will run successfully but the output would not be displayed 
well the output still came out
For readKey the normal output was expected and its what i got
is ReadKey necessary.

Differenc between public and private constants 

Public constants are accessible by all classes.

Private constants are accessible by only a particilar class.
